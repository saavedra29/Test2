        A simple game for improving your memory\n
        and compete against your friends. You simply\n
        have to find and match the pairs in order to\n
        \"empty\" the table as fast as possible. At\n
        the upper right menu you can select how\n
        many rounds to play each time, see the saved\n
        highscores and reset them if you want. If\n
        at any time the game loses focus by another\n
        application or minimizes afterwards the\n
        chronometer continues from the exact point\n
        it was left.\n
        Enjoy, review, comment and share. Thanks\n
        for trying the application!\n\n
